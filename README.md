## Chessfactory: hall of fame

![](etc/img/cf.png)

Idea of this project is find interesting chess games and to form my own 'Top N' rating by various criterias (see below)

Used tools:

* [lichess database](https://database.lichess.org/) 
* My fork of [chesspresso java lib](https://github.com/mark-dev/chesspresso)
* [Spring](https://spring.io/)
* [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.yandex/)

    
I scan lichess database and there is results:

1. Do you know [knight tour problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) ?
   [longest uncrossed knight path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_uncrossed_knight%27s_path)
   How do you think, what is longest 'distinct squares' path in real game?
   
2. What if i interesting find games, where mate reaches by knight promotion, and winning side has less material?

3. What the strongest knight fork? (by fork-ed material)  

4. Top games by average ranged pieces(B,R,Q) capture distance:

5. Take look for most valuable piece
    
   (Yes, need filtering games by hand, to avoid giveaway games like: https://lichess.org/IltUctI4 look on c7 pawn, future mvp queen :)) 
   
6. Let's find positions, where side can do a lot of captures? 
   Nonsense :)

7. Find position, when 8 pieces stay on one board-column:

8. Mate by en-passant move: 

9.
